This is the decompiled SRC of ICEHack-b1. I found the .jar lying around and this one isn't obfuscated so I could easily decompile it. This SRC is not buildable, so you can only jew code from it, But it's better than nothing.

The client is about a year old, so the code is pretty dated, but it still might have a few useful classes and modules for you to skid into your own client.
